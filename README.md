# 1.Introduction
This repository includes the source code of the paper “Deep Learning-Assisted Phaseless Near-Field Transformation for Accelerating Near-Field Scanning”
# 2.Usage
1) Run 'Data_generation.py' in Data generation directory. Copy the generated data (Data.h5) to DCNN training directory and Numerical validations directory.
2) Run 'DCNN_training.py' in DCNN training directory. Copy the trained DCNN (Trained_model.pth) to Numerical validations directory.
3) Run 'Testing data #1', 'Testing data #2', and 'Patch antennas array.py' to get results.
